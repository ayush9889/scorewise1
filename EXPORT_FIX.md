# Export Fix for MultiGroupDashboard Component

## Issue Description
The application was throwing a syntax error:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/MultiGroupDashboard.tsx?t=1750318891809' does not provide an export named 'MultiGroupDashboard' (at App.tsx:18:10)
```

## Root Cause
The `MultiGroupDashboard` component had a proper named export:
```typescript
export const MultiGroupDashboard: React.FC<MultiGroupDashboardProps> = ({
  onNavigate,
  onBack
}) => {
  // component implementation
};
```

But there might have been a file corruption or caching issue that prevented the export from being recognized properly.

## Solution Applied
1. **Verified Export Structure**: Confirmed the component uses named export (not default export)
2. **Confirmed Import Structure**: Verified App.tsx correctly imports with braces:
   ```typescript
   import { MultiGroupDashboard } from './components/MultiGroupDashboard';
   ```
3. **Build Verification**: Ran `npm run build` to ensure no syntax errors
4. **Development Server**: Restarted dev server to clear any caching issues

## Files Affected
- `src/components/MultiGroupDashboard.tsx` - Verified export structure
- `src/App.tsx` - Confirmed correct import statement

## Prevention
This type of issue can be prevented by:
1. **Consistent Export Patterns**: Use either named exports or default exports consistently across the project
2. **Build Verification**: Always run `npm run build` after making significant changes
3. **Cache Clearing**: Restart development server if experiencing unexplained import errors

## Current Export Pattern in Project
- **Named Exports**: Most components (Dashboard, AdminDashboard, GroupDashboard, MultiGroupDashboard, etc.)
- **Default Exports**: UserProfileDashboard only

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The application now builds and runs successfully.
