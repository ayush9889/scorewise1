# üöÄ ScoreWise Feature Updates

## 1. üèè Bowler Selection Fix

### Problem Solved
Previously, bowler selection had a confusing two-step process that was different from batsman selection. This has been **completely fixed**.

### Solution Implemented
- **Unified Interface**: Bowler selection now uses the exact same `PlayerSelector` component as batsman selection
- **One-Click Selection**: No more two-step process - select bowler directly from the same interface
- **Immediate Trigger**: When an over completes, the bowler selector appears instantly
- **Consistent UX**: Search, filter, and add players - all in one place

### How It Works Now
1. Complete an over (6 balls or bowler change needed)
2. **Automatically** get a mandatory bowler selection modal
3. **One-click** select from available bowlers
4. **Same interface** as batsman selection with search and add features
5. **Instant confirmation** and continue play

### Technical Details
- Uses `PlayerSelector` component (same as batsman selection)
- Mandatory selection for over completion
- Validation prevents consecutive overs by same bowler
- Immediate state updates with visual feedback
