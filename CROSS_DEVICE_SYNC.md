# Cross-Device Data Synchronization

## Overview
The ScoreWise app now features **automatic cross-device synchronization** that ensures your cricket data stays consistent across all devices using the same email account.

## Problem Solved
**Before**: Users experienced different data on laptop vs mobile phone even when using the same email account - groups, matches, and player statistics were not synchronized.

**After**: All data automatically syncs in real-time across devices. Changes made on your laptop immediately appear on your mobile phone and vice versa.

## How It Works

### User-Based Cloud Storage
- Data is organized by user email/phone in Firebase Cloud Firestore
- Each user gets their own dedicated cloud storage space
- Only data relevant to the logged-in user is synchronized

### Real-Time Synchronization
- **Automatic Sync**: Data syncs automatically when you log in and during app usage
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes sync immediately across all devices
- **Bi-Directional**: Works both ways - laptop ‚Üî mobile phone
- **Smart Merging**: Newer data takes precedence during conflicts

### Sync Components

#### 1. User Cloud Sync Service (`userCloudSyncService.ts`)
- Manages all cross-device synchronization
- Handles user-specific data organization
- Implements real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Provides conflict resolution (newest data wins)

#### 2. Cloud Sync Status Component (`CloudSyncStatus.tsx`)
- Shows current sync status in the Dashboard
- Displays last sync time and data counts
- Allows manual sync triggers
- Shows online/offline status

#### 3. Automatic Integration
- Sync starts automatically on login (email or phone)
- Stops automatically on logout
- Resumes on app restart/refresh

## Features

### ‚úÖ **What Gets Synced**
- **Groups**: All groups you're a member of
- **Matches**: All matches from your groups  
- **Players**: All players from your groups
- **User Profile**: Your personal cricket profile and stats
- **Group Memberships**: Your role and permissions in each group

### ‚úÖ **Sync Triggers**
- User login (email or phone authentication)
- App startup (session restoration)
- Manual sync button
- Real-time changes from other devices
- Periodic background sync

### ‚úÖ **Conflict Resolution**
- **Timestamp-based**: Newer data always wins
- **Smart Merging**: Combines local and cloud data intelligently
- **No Data Loss**: Older data is preserved unless explicitly overwritten

## User Experience

### Dashboard Sync Status
- **Green Cloud**: All synced and up-to-date
- **Yellow Cloud**: Synced but older than 5-30 minutes
- **Orange Cloud**: Needs sync (older than 30 minutes)
- **Red Cloud**: Offline - will sync when online

### Sync Indicators
- **"Just now"**: Synced within last minute
- **"Xm ago"**: Synced X minutes ago
- **"Xh ago"**: Synced X hours ago
- **"Never"**: No sync yet (new user)

### Manual Sync Button
- **"Sync Now"**: Force immediate sync
- **Spinning Icon**: Currently syncing
- **Disabled**: When offline or no user logged in

## Technical Implementation

### Data Organization
```
Firebase Collections:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/                     # User profiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_groups/              # Groups per user
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_matches/             # Matches per user  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_players/             # Players per user
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sync_metadata/            # Sync timestamps and stats
```

### User-Specific Documents
```
user_groups/{email}_{groupId}
user_matches/{email}_{matchId}
user_players/{email}_{playerId}
```

### Real-Time Subscriptions
- Firebase `onSnapshot` listeners for live updates
- Automatic re-sync when cloud data changes
- Efficient updates only when necessary

### Offline Support
- **Local Storage**: All data saved locally first
- **Queue Sync**: Changes queued when offline
- **Auto Sync**: Syncs automatically when back online
- **No Data Loss**: Offline changes preserved until sync

## Security & Privacy

### User Isolation
- Each user's data is completely separate
- Email/phone-based access control
- No cross-user data visibility

### Data Ownership
- Users only sync their own group data
- No access to groups they're not members of
- Automatic cleanup when leaving groups

## Benefits

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Sync Status Information
- Last sync timestamp
- Cloud data counts (groups, matches, players)
- Device information and sync history
- Error logs and retry status

### Debug Information

## Support

### Common Issues
**Q: My data isn't syncing between devices**  
A: Check you're using the same email account on both devices and have internet connection

**Q: Sync shows "Never" even though I'm online**  
A: Try the "Sync Now" button or restart the app

**Q: Different data on different devices**  
A: Use "Sync Now" on both devices, newest data will be kept

**Q: Can I use different email accounts on different devices?**  
A: No, you must use the same email account for cross-device sync to work
